	<h3>Coding Portfolio</h3>
		<hr>
			<p>Here is collection of my coding projects. All of them can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/BNewing/">GitHub account</a>.</p>

			<a href="https://github.com/BNewing/to-do-list-v2"><h3>To Do List</h3></a>
			<p>This is a To Do list app! You can enter a maximum
				of ten items and then drag and drop them between 'Done', 'Priority' and
				'Not Priority. Each item has a status label, and if you click on it, it turns to Done
				and moves the item to the 'Done' category. It also changes back to Pending if you move
				it to another list.
				<br><br>
      The app stores the list items in the browser, and is written in pure JavaScript.
      There is no jQuery though this would have made it easier - I wanted to make it harder so I'd learn more.
			It has drag and drop functionality and is wrapped up with Webpack and Stylus into code bundles.</p>

			<a href="https://github.com/BNewing/bnewing.github.io"><h3>This Website</h3></a>
			<p> This website is for grouping information together about me. It's a not-so-serious
				CV website.
				<br><br>
				This website is written in HTML and uses Twitter Bootstrap and has modular CSS. Next steps are to webpack it up and use
      CSS Pre-processors on it and add some animation in with an animation library. I'm also planning to add in a
      contact form</p>

		<div class='col col-sm-12 col-xs-12 bubble'>
			<a href="https://github.com/BNewing/rainbowPoems"><h3>Rainbow Poems</h3></a>
			<p>My aunt suggested this project! When you go on the page, you're asked to select which
				poem you want to see. You then click a button to activate the rainbow colours,
				which cascade down the poem!
				<br><br>
				This is one of the first mini projects I built. It's written in Javascript
				with a little bit of functional programming involved. It was how I reinforced
				my knowledge of interacting with the DOM.
