	<p class="bio__text">I'm a front-end developer, former organiser of codebar Oxford and Code First: Girls lead instructor. I'm also a public speaker, blogger, and huuuuge fan of cute animals.</p>

	<p class="bio__text">I'm pretty passionate about accessibility and inclusion. In a world that is becoming increasingly digital, it's super important that we make sure it's accessible for everyone. I love accessibility reviews doing at work and on open source projects, and volunteering with the diversity in tech movement.</p>
