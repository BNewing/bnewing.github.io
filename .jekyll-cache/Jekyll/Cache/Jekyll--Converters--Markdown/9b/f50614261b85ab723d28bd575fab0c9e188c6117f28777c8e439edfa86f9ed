<p>Here is a small collection of my favourite projects that I've worked on. I used to work for an agency, and unfortunately not all of that work is publically available. But below is a selection my favourite things that are!</p>

<p class="intro-text">The full list of (publically available) things I've been working on can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/BNewing/">GitHub account</a>. I'm also <a href="https://codepen.io/WebDevBev/">WebDevBev</a> on codepen, where I mess around with CSS sometimes!</p>

			<p class="card__text">I worked on a WordPress cookie banner to roll out across our WordPress websites, at the Ministry of Justice. I researched GDPR requirements by reading legislation and attending events by others who specialised in this field to understand what we needed to implement. I then worked collaboratively with the interaction designer and content designer to create the banner, and we WCAG audited versions of it and iterated, to make it accessible. It allows for people to turn</p>

			<p class="card__text">At the Ministry of Justice, we have a lot of Arms Length Bodies, and they all need their own accessible websites. They also all need have different branding to the standard UK government branding. I worked on a WordPress theme for these websites, which we called Hale. It was based off of an NHS theme that I identified in the cross-gov community. We also created companion Guternberg blocks to sit with the theme. We also trained the teams at the Arms Length Bodies in accessible content creation, to help them preserve the accessibility of the sites going ahead.</p>

It's full of accessibility exercise, and there's an answers page at the moment - so you can run through it, and test your accessibility knowledge. I run this as a workshop both at work and for meetups and conferences.</p>

			<p class="card__text">Three Rings CIC needed a new website, as their old one was out of date. I mapped out a new content architecture, designed some wireframes, got feedback from stakeholders, and iterated on the designs. I then created a WordPress theme, and components using Gutenberg, so that editors would more easily be able to create new pages and edit existing ones. I've been volunteering with Three Rings for over 8 years now, and loved getting to better showcase the hard work all the other lovely and wonderful people there do!</p>
