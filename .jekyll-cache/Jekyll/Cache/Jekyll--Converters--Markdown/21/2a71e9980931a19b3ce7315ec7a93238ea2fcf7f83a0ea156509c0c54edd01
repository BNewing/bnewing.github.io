		<h1 class="bio__title">Hi, I'm Beverley</h1>
		<p class="bio__text">I'm an accessibility specialist, front-end developer, former organiser of codebar Oxford and Code First: Girls lead instructor. I'm also a public speaker, blogger, and huuuuge fan of cute animals. My current role is Accessibility Lead at the UK Ministry of Justice.</p>
		<p class="bio__text">I'm pretty passionate about accessibility and inclusion. In a world that is becoming increasingly digital, it's really important that everyone can participate.</p>
		<p>In my spare time, I like to sew, bird watch, go out on the motorbike, and sometimes write blog posts about those thing. I'm non-binary, and my pronouns are they/them.</p>
