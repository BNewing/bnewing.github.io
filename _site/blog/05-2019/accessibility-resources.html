		<p>As it’s Global Accessibility Awareness, I’m sharing a list of accessibility resources that I regularly refer to. Happy reading, watching and listening!</p>

<h2 class="blog__subtitle">Books</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		<a href="https://abookapart.com/products/accessibility-for-everyone">'Accessibility for Everyone' by Laura Kalbag</a>
		<p class="blog__link-description">This is a great introduction to accessibility as a topic. I highly recommend it as the first thing you read!</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="https://shop.smashingmagazine.com/products/inclusive-design-patterns-by-heydon-pickering-ebook">‘Inclusive Design Patterns’ by Heydon Pickering</a>
		<p class="blog__link-description">I am a huge fan of Heydon Pickering and his accessibility work, and Inclusive Design Patterns is a book that I regularly go back to. Brilliant introduction to accessibility and how to implement things well, with lots of HTML guidance.</p>	
	</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="blog__subtitle">Webinars and newsletters</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		<a href="https://a11yweekly.com/">A11y Weekly</a>
		<p class="blog__link-description">I now regularly look forward to these weekly newsletters! They include a collection of really interesting articles from all over the internet. I’ve learnt a huge amount from these in a very short space of time.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="https://abilitynet.org.uk/free-resources/webinars">AbilityNet Webinars</a>
		<p class="blog__link-description">The quality of these webinars from AbilityNet are amazing! These people are experts in this field and it really shows. I highly recommend giving their talks a listen to.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="blog__subtitle">Articles</h2>			
<ul>			
	<li>
		<a href="https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2017/02/24/what-we-found-when-we-tested-tools-on-the-worlds-least-accessible-webpage/">‘What we found when we tested tools on the world’s least-accessible webpage’, GOV.UK accessibility blog</a>
		<p class="blog__link-description">GDS did a fantastic piece of research into the effectiveness of automated testing. They created a very inaccessible website and ran a variety of automated tools. Spoiler; the top tool could only get 40% of issues.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="https://webaim.org/projects/million/">The WebAIM 1 million</a>
		<p class="blog__link-description">This is an amazing and slightly horrifying study that WebAIM completed this year. They took the top 1 million websites and ran an automated testing tool over their home pages. As well as it being a brilliant piece of research, they’ve also documented how they went about it really well. </p>
	</li>		
	<li>
		<a href="https://alphagov.github.io/wcag-primer/#what-is-wcag-2-1">GOV.UK WCAG 2.1 Primer</a>
		<p class="blog__link-description">This guide does a nice job of breaking down the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines into slightly more readable language, but still links back to them. It also contains a nice checklist of questions you can ask yourself throughout the process of building anything.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="http://adrianroselli.com/2017/11/a-responsive-accessible-table.html">'A Responsive, Accessible Table' by Adrian Roselli</a>
		<p class="blog__link-description">Whilst this is a bit niche, I had to include it because it’s such a beautiful illustration of how complex accessibility problems can be solved really elegantly. I really love pieces of writing like this.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="blog__subtitle">Talks</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oG_cYElSZwM">‘Accessibility is more than just supporting screen readers’ by Seren Davies</a>
		<p class="blog__link-description">This talk is a fantastic introduction to accessibility, and how broad it is. Seren does a fantastic job of talking about different issues and some practical solutions, and also exploring the cognitive side of accessibility too.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey7/">'Screen Reader User Survey #7' by WebAIM</a>
		<p class="blog__link-description">This is a really great resource for checking that you’re testing with the most popular screen readers, and with the right browser combination. It’s worth noting though that this is a survey of everyone, and the user group for what you are creating might be different.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just a fraction of the awesome resources out there. if there’s anything that you refer to as well on a regular basis, let me know! I’d love to hear about what you find useful too.</p>
