&lt;p&gt;As it’s Global Accessibility Awareness, I’m sharing a list of accessibility resources that I regularly refer to. Happy reading, watching and listening!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;blog__subtitle&quot;&gt;Books&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;a href=&quot;https://abookapart.com/products/accessibility-for-everyone&quot;&gt;'Accessibility for Everyone' by Laura Kalbag&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;p class=&quot;blog__link-description&quot;&gt;This is a great introduction to accessibility as a topic. I highly recommend it as the first thing you read!&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;a href=&quot;https://shop.smashingmagazine.com/products/inclusive-design-patterns-by-heydon-pickering-ebook&quot;&gt;‘Inclusive Design Patterns’ by Heydon Pickering&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;p class=&quot;blog__link-description&quot;&gt;I am a huge fan of Heydon Pickering and his accessibility work, and Inclusive Design Patterns is a book that I regularly go back to. Brilliant introduction to accessibility and how to implement things well, with lots of HTML guidance.&lt;/p&gt;	
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;blog__subtitle&quot;&gt;Webinars and newsletters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;a href=&quot;https://a11yweekly.com/&quot;&gt;A11y Weekly&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;p class=&quot;blog__link-description&quot;&gt;I now regularly look forward to these weekly newsletters! They include a collection of really interesting articles from all over the internet. I’ve learnt a huge amount from these in a very short space of time.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;a href=&quot;https://abilitynet.org.uk/free-resources/webinars&quot;&gt;AbilityNet Webinars&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;p class=&quot;blog__link-description&quot;&gt;The quality of these webinars from AbilityNet are amazing! These people are experts in this field and it really shows. I highly recommend giving their talks a listen to.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;blog__subtitle&quot;&gt;Articles&lt;/h2&gt;			
&lt;ul&gt;			
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;a href=&quot;https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2017/02/24/what-we-found-when-we-tested-tools-on-the-worlds-least-accessible-webpage/&quot;&gt;‘What we found when we tested tools on the world’s least-accessible webpage’, GOV.UK accessibility blog&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;p class=&quot;blog__link-description&quot;&gt;GDS did a fantastic piece of research into the effectiveness of automated testing. They created a very inaccessible website and ran a variety of automated tools. Spoiler; the top tool could only get 40% of issues.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;a href=&quot;https://webaim.org/projects/million/&quot;&gt;The WebAIM 1 million&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;p class=&quot;blog__link-description&quot;&gt;This is an amazing and slightly horrifying study that WebAIM completed this year. They took the top 1 million websites and ran an automated testing tool over their home pages. As well as it being a brilliant piece of research, they’ve also documented how they went about it really well. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;		
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;a href=&quot;https://alphagov.github.io/wcag-primer/#what-is-wcag-2-1&quot;&gt;GOV.UK WCAG 2.1 Primer&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;p class=&quot;blog__link-description&quot;&gt;This guide does a nice job of breaking down the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines into slightly more readable language, but still links back to them. It also contains a nice checklist of questions you can ask yourself throughout the process of building anything.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;a href=&quot;http://adrianroselli.com/2017/11/a-responsive-accessible-table.html&quot;&gt;'A Responsive, Accessible Table' by Adrian Roselli&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;p class=&quot;blog__link-description&quot;&gt;Whilst this is a bit niche, I had to include it because it’s such a beautiful illustration of how complex accessibility problems can be solved really elegantly. I really love pieces of writing like this.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;blog__subtitle&quot;&gt;Talks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oG_cYElSZwM&quot;&gt;‘Accessibility is more than just supporting screen readers’ by Seren Davies&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;p class=&quot;blog__link-description&quot;&gt;This talk is a fantastic introduction to accessibility, and how broad it is. Seren does a fantastic job of talking about different issues and some practical solutions, and also exploring the cognitive side of accessibility too.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;a href=&quot;https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey7/&quot;&gt;'Screen Reader User Survey #7' by WebAIM&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;p class=&quot;blog__link-description&quot;&gt;This is a really great resource for checking that you’re testing with the most popular screen readers, and with the right browser combination. It’s worth noting though that this is a survey of everyone, and the user group for what you are creating might be different.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just a fraction of the awesome resources out there. if there’s anything that you refer to as well on a regular basis, let me know! I’d love to hear about what you find useful too.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">&lt;!-- Stuff to pull out to liquid stuff: - Image - h1 - Published date</summary></entry></feed>
