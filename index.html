		<h1 class="bio__title">Hi! I'm Beverley</h1>
		<p class="bio__text">I'm an accessibility lead and front-end developer. My current role is Accessibility Lead at the UK Ministry of Justice, which I've had since April 2021.</p>
		<p class="bio__text">I also do a lot of volunteering. I currently volunteer on the dev team of <a href="https://www.threerings.org.uk/">Three Rings CIC</a>. We provide volunteer management software for organisations like the Samaritans and Childline, at low cost to them. In the past, I've set up and run <a href="https://codebar.io/">codebar Oxford</a> for 2 years, and taught on <a href="https://codebar.io/">Code First: Girls</a> courses, to try and help diversity the tech industry. </p>
		<p>In my spare time, I like to give the occasional tech talk, and write the odd blog post. I also sew (I am obsessed with Drag Race), and go out on long rides on the motorbike. My pronouns are they/them.</p>
